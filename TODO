MOVE EO SECTION: check that everything still works (and that I don't say things
like "in section 4 below...")

avvisa tizio giapponese della versione 3


================
DONE:

- uploaded theproject on github
- fixed a gazillion typos, updated references
- reorganized some section: now EO is in chapter 2, right after insertions
- Add stuff on edge insertion (5e, section on free slices and advanced edge)
- replaced .png images with .svg (much better!)
- added "old style" PDR 
- how to practice: use pen and paper
- removed appendix C, I just link the file
- skew centers & niss
- add small section "replace and shorten"?
- NISS + EO
- added appendix D and references to DR tutorial
- appendix C: Reto's exercises
- The structure of the document is still the same, even though this might seem outdated in some parts (for example, it feels a bit odd nowadays that EO starts are in the "Some other ways" capter; or the fact that I say that 5e skeletons are "usually bad", when I got a world record with such a skeleton)
